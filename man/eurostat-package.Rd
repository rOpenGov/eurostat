\section{Eurostat}{
Eurostat website: \url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat}
Eurostat database: \url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/main/data/database}

Information about the data update schedule from Eurostat:
"Eurostat datasets are updated twice a day at 11:00 and 23:00 CET, if newer
data is available or for structural changes, for example for the
dimensions in the dataset.

The Eurostat database always contains the latest version of the datasets,
meaning that there is no versioning or documentation of past versions of
the data."
}

\section{Data source: Eurostat SDMX 2.1 Dissemination API}{
Data is downloaded from Eurostat SDMX 2.1 API endpoint
as compressed TSV files that are transformed into tabular format.
See Eurostat documentation for more information:
\url{https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/EUROSTATHELP/API+SDMX+2.1+-+data+query}

The new dissemination API replaces the old bulk download facility that was
used by Eurostat before October 2023 and by the eurostat R package versions
before 4.0.0.
See Eurostat documentation about the transition from Bulk Download to API
for more information about the differences between the old bulk download
facility and the data provided by the new API connection:
\url{https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/EUROSTATHELP/Transition+-+from+Eurostat+Bulk+Download+to+API}

See especially the document Migrating_to_API_TSV.pdf that describes the
changes in TSV file format in new applications.

For more information about SDMX 2.1, see SDMX standards: Section 7:
Guidelines for the use of web services, Version 2.1:
\url{https://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/SDMX_2-1_SECTION_7_WebServicesGuidelines.pdf}
}

\section{Disclaimer: Availability of filtering functionalities}{
Currently it only possible to download filtered data through API Statistics
(JSON API) when using \code{eurostat} package, although technically filtering
datasets downloaded through the SDMX Dissemination API is also supported by
Eurostat. We may support this feature in the future. In the meantime, if you
are interested in filtering Dissemination API data queries manually, please
consult the following Eurostat documentation:
\url{https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/EUROSTATHELP/API+SDMX+2.1+-+data+filtering}
}

\section{Data source: Eurostat API Statistics (JSON API)}{
Data is downloaded from Eurostat API Statistics. See Eurostat documentation
for more information about data queries in API Statistics
\url{https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/EUROSTATHELP/API+Statistics+-+data+query}

This replaces the old JSON Web Services that was used by Eurostat before
February 2023 and by the eurostat R package versions before 3.7.13.
See Eurostat documentation about the migration from JSON web service to API
Statistics for more information about the differences between the old and
the new service:
\url{https://wikis.ec.europa.eu/display/EUROSTATHELP/API+Statistics+-+migrating+from+JSON+web+service+to+API+Statistics}

For easily viewing which filtering options are available -  in addition to
the default ones, time and language - Eurostat Web services Query builder
tool may be useful:
\url{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/query-builder}
}

\section{Filtering datasets}{
When using Eurostat API Statistics (JSON API), datasets can be filtered
before they are downloaded and saved in local memory. The general format
for filter parameters is \verb{<DIMENSION_CODE>=<VALUE>}.

Filter parameters are optional but the used dimension codes must be present
in the data product that is being queried. Dimension codes can
vary between different data products so it may be useful to examine new
datasets in Eurostat data browser beforehand. However, most if not all
Eurostat datasets concern European countries and contain information that
was gathered at some point in time, so \code{geo} and \code{time} dimension codes
can usually be used.

\verb{<DIMENSION_CODE>} and \verb{<VALUE>} are case-insensitive and they can be written
in lowercase or uppercase in the query.

Parameters are passed onto the \code{eurostat} package functions \code{\link[=get_eurostat]{get_eurostat()}}
and \code{\link[=get_eurostat_json]{get_eurostat_json()}} as a list item. If an individual item contains
multiple items, as it often can be in the case of \code{geo} parameters and
other optional items, they must be in the form of a vector: \code{c("FI", "SE")}.
For examples on how to use these parameters, see function examples below.
\subsection{Time parameters}{

\code{time} and \code{time_period} address the same \code{TIME_PERIOD} dimension in the
dataset and can be used interchangeably. In the Eurostat documentation
it is stated that "Using more than one Time parameter in the same query
is not accepted", but practice has shown that actually Eurostat API allows
multiple \code{time} parameters in the same query. This makes it possible to
use R colon operator when writing queries, so \code{time = c(2015:2018)}
translates to \verb{&time=2015&time=2016&time=2017&time=2018}.

The only exception
to this is when the queried dataset contains e.g. quarterly data and
\code{TIME_PERIOD} is saved as \code{2015-Q1}, \code{2015-Q2} etc. Then it is possible
to use \code{time=2015-Q1&time=2015-Q2} style in the query URL, but this makes it
unfeasible to use the colon operator and requires a lot of manual typing.

Because of this, it is useful to know about other time parameters as well:
\itemize{
\item \code{untilTimePeriod}: return dataset items from the oldest record up until the
set time, for example "all data until 2000": \code{untilTimePeriod = 2000}
\item \code{sinceTimePeriod}: return dataset items starting from set time, for example
"all datastarting from 2008": \code{sinceTimePeriod = 2008}
\item \code{lastTimePeriod}: starting from the most recent time period, how many
preceding time periods should be returned? For example 10 most
recent observations: \code{lastTimePeriod = 10}
}

Using both \code{untilTimePeriod} and \code{sinceTimePeriod} parameters in the same
query is allowed, making the usage of the R colon operator unnecessary.
In the case of quarterly data, using \code{untilTimePeriod} and \code{sinceTimePeriod}
parameters also works, as opposed to the colon operator, so it is generally
safer to use them as well.
}

\subsection{Other dimensions}{

In \code{\link[=get_eurostat_json]{get_eurostat_json()}} examples \code{nama_10_gdp} dataset is filtered with
two additional filter parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{na_item = "B1GQ"}
\item \code{unit = "CLV_I10"}
}

Filters like these are most likely unique to the \code{nama_10_gdp} dataset
(or other datasets within the same domain) and should
not be used with others dataset without user discretion.
By using \code{\link[=label_eurostat]{label_eurostat()}} we know that \code{"B1GQ"} stands for
"Gross domestic product at market prices" and
\code{"CLV_I10"} means "Chain linked volumes, index 2010=100".

Different dimension codes can be translated to a natural language by using
the \code{\link[=get_eurostat_dic]{get_eurostat_dic()}} function, which returns labels for individual
dimension items such as \code{na_item} and \code{unit}, as opposed to
\code{\link[=label_eurostat]{label_eurostat()}} which does it for whole datasets. For example, the
parameter \code{na_item} stands for "National accounts indicator (ESA 2010)" and
\code{unit} stands for "Unit of measure".
}

\subsection{Language}{

All datasets have metadata available in English, French and German. If no
parameter is given, the labels are returned in English.

Example:
\itemize{
\item \code{lang = "fr"}
}
}

"(c) European Union, 1995 - today

Eurostat has a policy of encouraging free re-use of its data, both for
non-commercial and commercial purposes. All statistical data, metadata,
content of web pages or other dissemination tools, official publications
and other documents published on its website, with the exceptions listed
below, can be reused without any payment or written licence provided that:
\itemize{
\item the source is indicated as Eurostat;
\item when re-use involves modifications to the data or text, this must be

\section{Citing Eurostat data}{
For citing datasets, use \code{\link[=get_bibentry]{get_bibentry()}} to build a bibliography that
is suitable for your reference manager of choice.

When using Eurostat data in other contexts than academic publications that
in-text citations or footnotes/endnotes, the following guidelines may be
helpful:
\itemize{
\item The origin of the data should always be mentioned as "Source: Eurostat".
\item The online dataset codes(s) should also be provided in order to ensure
transparency and facilitate access to the Eurostat data and related
methodological information. For example:
"Source: Eurostat (online data code: namq_10_gdp)"
\item Online publications (e.g. web pages, PDF) should include a clickable
link to the dataset using the bookmark functionality available in the
Eurostat data browser.
}

It should be avoided to associate different entities (e.g. Eurostat,
National Statistical Offices, other data providers) to the same dataset or
indicator without specifying the role of each of them in the treatment of
data.

See also section "Eurostat: Copyright notice and free re-use of data"
in \code{\link[=get_eurostat]{get_eurostat()}} documentation.
}

\section{Strategies for handling large datasets more efficiently}{
Most Eurostat datasets are relatively manageable, at least on a machine
with 16 GB of RAM. The largest dataset in Eurostat database, at the time
of writing this, had 148362539 (148 million) values, which results in an
object with 148 million rows in tidy data (long) format. The test machine
with 16 GB of RAM was able to handle the second largest dataset in the
database with 91 million values (rows).

There are still some methods to make data fetching
functions perform faster:
\itemize{
\item turn caching off: \code{get_eurostat(cache = FALSE)}
\item turn cache compression off (may result in rather large cache files!):
\code{get_eurostat(compress_file = FALSE)}
\item if you want faster caching with manageable file sizes, use stringsAsFactors:
\code{get_eurostat(cache = TRUE, compress_file = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)}
\item Use faster data.table functions: \code{get_eurostat(use.data.table = TRUE)}
\item Keep column processing to a minimum:
\code{get_eurostat(time_format = "raw", type = "code")} etc.
\item Read \code{get_eurostat()} function documentation carefully so you understand
what different arguments do
\item Filter the dataset so that you fetch only the parts you need!
}
}
